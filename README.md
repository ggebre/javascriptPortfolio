# ABOUT THE PRODUCT
This web application is to help people who will be taking the civic test as part of the naturalization process in the United States. The landing page prompts 
users to select from a dropdown the state and district they reside so as to customize the answers to their state and district.

they can select flashcards to study all the questions that will be expected during the interview process. Users can also leave comments.
